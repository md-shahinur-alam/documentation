   If you are not on PHP 8.1 and you don't see the update, refer to [Upgrade PHP Versions](https://docs.pantheon.io/guides/php/php-versions) for instructions on updating your PHP version.

1. Run [Drupal's Upgrade Status](https://www.drupal.org/project/upgrade_status).

1. Use [Composer to update](/guides/upgrade-drupal-8-ic-to-drupal-9#set-drupal-core-version) to Drupal 10. Refer to the [Drupal release-specific documentation](https://www.drupal.org/project/drupal/releases) for more information.
