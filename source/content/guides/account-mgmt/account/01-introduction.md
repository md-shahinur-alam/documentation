The first thing you need to do when starting with Pantheon is create an account. A Pantheon account lets you:

- Purchase plans
- Manage your workspaces
- Pay your bills

[Create your account for free](https://pantheon.io/register?docs).

Are you an agency? Do you build sites for others? If so, check **Are you an agency?** on the [sign-up form](https://pantheon.io/register?docs) to get more free features. There are no restrictions on agency size. You can sign up if you're an agency of one or an agency of one thousand.
