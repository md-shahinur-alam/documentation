After you create an account and sign in, you are taken to your home page, known as your Personal Workspace.  Here you can view key information at a glance, including the sites you own or are a team member of, your plan tier, and more.

## Tabs

The navigation bar on the left contains several additional tabs to help you manage your sites:

- **Sites:** Add a new site, view sites you're a team member of, and check how many free sites you have remaining.

  - **Create New Site:** Start the process of creating a new site on Pantheon. New sites will appear under the Sites tab.

  - **Migrate Existing Site:** Start a guided migration to add a site. If youâ€™re importing a site from your local environment, follow our [manual migration process](/migrate-manual).  For information about migrating a site from a competitor, or other migration scenarios, refer to [Migrate Sites to Pantheon](/guides/guided/) on our [Get Started](/get-started) page.

- **Team*:** Create a new workspace.

- **Autopilot:** [Autopilot](/guides/autopilot) is Visual Regression Testing (VRT) for every WordPress and Drupal Site within your workspace.

- **Support:** View details of an open support request or create a new support request. Our chat-based support is available 24-hours a day.

- **Custom Upstreams*:** Create a new workspace-specific [Custom Upstream](/guides/custom-upstream) using a GitHub or Bitbucket repository. Custom Upstreams allow you to use an external repository as a template for your site.

- **Settings:** Modify the workspace name, logo, billing information, and if your Organization is configured for it, billing terms and instructions for your team.

\* Not available in Personal Workspaces.
