This section provides information on how to open a support ticket as well as other ways to contact support.

## Ticket Support

The ticket support feature is available to certain Account packages and account types. For details, refer to the [support feature table](/guides/support/#support-features-and-response-times). Tickets are associated with the site from which the ticket is opened. Please be sure that if you maintain several sites, that you open the ticket from the correct site's dashboard.

1. Create a support ticket from within the site's Dashboard by clicking **Support** > **Open Ticket**. This will automatically include the site and user information.

1. Choose the **ticket type**.

1. Enter a subject (summary of your issue).

1. Provide a detailed summary of your support request, such as:
   - Steps to reproduce the issue (including URLs or paths to files).
   - Environments affected (Multidev/Dev/Test/Live), if applicable.
   - When the issue began.
   - Error messages received, if applicable.
   - Links to screenshots or screencasts of the behavior, if necessary.

1. Click **Open Ticket**

Once a ticket is submitted, you can view details for your support requests. If are you are part of an organization, your support tickets are visible to all members except [Unprivileged users](/guides/account-mgmt/workspace-sites-teams/teams#organizations-roles-and-permissions).

## Real Time Chat Support

Start a chat with our Support Team to ask questions or request assistance on issues within our [scope of support](#scope-of-support). This support feature is available to all users and sites across all plans, including Sandbox.

To receive the highest level of support available to your site or organization, remember to access the chat from the Organization Dashboard if available.

1. From your Site or User Dashboard, click **Support**.

1. Click **Launch Chat**, then click **New Conversation**.

1. Provide a detailed summary of your support request, such as:
   - Steps to reproduce the issue (including URLs or paths to files).
   - Environments affected (Multidev/Dev/Test/Live), if applicable.
   - When the issue began.
   - Error messages received, if applicable.
   - Links to screenshots or screencasts of the behavior, if necessary.

You can download a transcript of your chat with the <em class="fa fa-arrow-down" style="text-decoration: underline;"></em> button:

Some in-browser ad or tracking blockers can interfere with the **Launch Chat** button. If you don't see it, try allowlisting `pantheon.io` or disabling the browser extension. Intercom has posted more details on [why this happens](https://www.intercom.com/help/en/articles/1200-why-am-i-missing-users-that-are-showing-up-on-my-own-system) on their site.
