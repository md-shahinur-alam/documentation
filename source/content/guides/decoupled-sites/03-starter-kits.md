## Create the CMS Backend

You can create a Front-End Site by using a Pantheon starter kit. Choose either a WordPress or Drupal CMS and connect it to the frontend application to create a site. The following configurations exist for the starter kit templates:

* Drupal and Next.js
* WordPress and Next.js
* WordPress and Gatsby

## Backend Installation and Configuration

Choose from the following approaches to configure your backend:

* Dashboard Upstream:
  * If you prefer a more streamlined configuration; this is the Pantheon recommended option.

* Build Tools:
  * If testing is important to your team's workflow. You will not have to manually push changes to your Pantheon code repository.

<Tab title="Drupal Backend" id="drupal-install" active={true}>

#### Dashboard Upstream Install

Install the Drupal backend using the Dashboard upstream.

Navigate to the Pantheon Dashboard to create a site from the [Decoupled Drupal Composer Managed upstream](https://dashboard.pantheon.io/sites/create?upstream_id=c76c0e51-ad85-41d7-b095-a98a75869760) 

Alternatively, you can use Terminus. Enter the following command to create a site with the Decoupled Drupal Composer Managed upstream.

```bash{promptUser: user}
terminus site:create my-new-site "Describe Site" --org='My Team Name' c76c0e51-ad85-41d7-b095-a98a75869760
```

  * Replace `{My Team Name}` with your team name, for example `My Agency`. This can also be omitted.
  * Note that `c76c0e51-ad85-41d7-b095-a98a75869760` is the `upstream_id` for Decoupled Drupal Composer Managed.

#### Install Using Build Tools

- Run `terminus build:project:create`:

  ```bash{outputLines:2-6}
  terminus build:project:create \
  --team='{My Team Name}' \
  --template-repository="git@github.com:pantheon-upstreams/decoupled-drupal-composer-managed.git" pantheon-upstreams/decoupled-drupal-composer-managed \
  --visibility private {PROJECT_NAME} \
  --profile="pantheon_decoupled_profile" \
  --stability=dev
  ```

  * Replace `{PROJECT_NAME}` with your project name, for example `decoupled-drupal`.

  * Replace `{My Team Name}` with your team name, for example `My Agency`. This can also be omitted.

This action will result in a GitHub repository created for this new codebase under the authenticated user's namespace (unless the `--org` option is used), a site created on Pantheon, and a CircleCI project created for automated deployments.

</Tab>

<Tab title="WordPress Backend" id="wordpress-install">

Create a [Decoupled WordPress Composer-Managed](https://dashboard.pantheon.io/sites/create?upstream_id=c9f5e5c0-248f-4205-b63a-d2729572dd1f) upstream using the Pantheon Dashboard.

Alternatively, you can run `terminus build:project:create`:

  ```bash{promptUser: user}
  terminus site:create my-new-site "Describe Site" --org='My Team Name' c9f5e5c0-248f-4205-b63a-d2729572dd1f
  ```

  * Replace `{PROJECT_NAME}` with a Project name for example `decoupled-wordpress`.

  * Replace `{My Team Name}` with your team name - for example `My Agency`. This can also be omitted.

  * The `upstream_id` for Decoupled WordPress Composer Managed is`c9f5e5c0-248f-4205-b63a-d2729572dd1f`.

This will result in a GitHub repository created for this new codebase, a site created on Pantheon and a CircleCI project created for automated deployments.

### Additional Configuration Options

#### Installing with Umami Demo Data

 <Alert title="Note"  type="info" >
 The following configuration can only be used on Drupal backend sites.
 </Alert>

The installation command in the section above will create a backend with limited example content. If you would like to run the Umami Demo site, you will need to add the site configuration. 

To create a site with Drupal's Umami demo data, change the profile flag in the `terminus build:project:create` command to the following:

```none
--profile="pantheon_decoupled_umami_demo"
```

#### Using Other Git Hosts or CI Services

Terminus build tools supports a number of other combinations of Git hosts and CI services.

For example, to use GitHub actions as your CI service, you could add the following additional flag to your `terminus build:project:create` command:

```none
--ci=githubactions
```

Other possible values include:

* `circleci`
* `gitlab-pipelines`
* `bitbucket-pipelines`

If you are using GitHub Actions, your token should have the "workflow" scope.

For more information, refer to the [Available Services](https://github.com/pantheon-systems/terminus-build-tools-plugin#available-services) section or the Build Tools [documentation](/guides/build-tools/). For a list of all available Build Tools command options, see the [Build Tools Project README](https://github.com/pantheon-systems/terminus-build-tools-plugin/blob/3.x/README.md#buildprojectcreate).

#### Using a GitHub Organization

If you would like the repo created to be under a GitHub organization instead of the authenticated user's namespace, you can use the `--org` option:

```none
--org="{My Organization Name}"
```

For information on additional options, refer to the [Command Options](https://github.com/pantheon-systems/terminus-build-tools-plugin#command-options) section of the build tools documentation.

For information on additional options, refer to the [Command Options](https://github.com/pantheon-systems/terminus-build-tools-plugin#command-options) section or see our Build Tools [documentation](/guides/build-tools/).

## Frontend Starter Configurations

<TabList>
<Tab title="Drupal + Next.js" id="nextdrupal-front-install" active={true}>

The `next-drupal-starter` is designed as a starting point for a Next.js site that consumes data from a Drupal backend - specifically a Drupal backend
configured with the [`pantheon_decoupled` module](https://www.drupal.org/project/pantheon_decoupled) installed.

The starter has a dependency on the `@pantheon-systems/drupal-kit`.

### Creating A New Project with the Drupal and Next.js Starter Template

There are two methods that can be used to create a new project based on the `next-drupal-starter`:

* Clone the starter repository
* Use `create-next-app`

To clone the starter directly from GitHub, visit the repository link https://github.com/pantheon-systems/next-drupal-starter and click **Code** to open the clone dropdown and select your preferred method.

To create a new project using `create-next-app`, enter the following command:

```bash{promptUser: user}
npx create-next-app -e https://github.com/pantheon-systems/next-drupal-starter --use-npm
```

The command `create-next-app` uses the `yarn` package manager by default. Omit the `--use-npm` flag to use `yarn`, or keep it to use `npm`.
</Tab>

<Tab title="WP + Next.js" id="nextwordpress-front-install" active={true}>

The `next-wordpress-starter` is designed as a starting point to for a Next.js site that consumes data from a WordPress backend - specifically a WordPress
backend configured with the `pantheon-decoupled` and `wp-graphql` plugins installed.

The starter has a dependency on the `@pantheon-systems/wordpress-kit`.

### Creating A New Project with the WordPress and Next.js Starter Template

There are two methods that can be used to create a new project based on the `next-wordpress-starter`:

* Clone the starter repository
* Use `create-next-app`

To clone the starter directly from GitHub, visit the repository link https://github.com/pantheon-systems/next-wordpress-starter and click **Code** to open the clone dropdown and select your preferred method.

To create a new project using `create-next-app`, enter the following command:

```bash{promptUser: user}
npx create-next-app -e https://github.com/pantheon-systems/next-wordpress-starter --use-npm
```

The `create-next-app` command uses the `yarn` package manager by default. Omit the `--use-npm` flag to use `yarn`, or keep it to use `npm`.
</Tab>

<Tab title="WP + Gatsby" id="wpsgatsby-front-install" active={true}>

The `gatsby-wordpress-starter` is designed as a starting point for a Gatsby site that consumes data from a WordPress backend - specifically a WordPress
backend configured with the `pantheon-decoupled` and `wp-graphql` plugins installed.

The starter has a dependency on the `@pantheon-systems/wordpress-kit`.

### Creating A New Project with the WordPress and Gatsby Starter Template

There are two methods that can be used to create a new project with the `gatsby-wordpress-starter`:

* Clone the starter repository
* Use the `gatsby-cli`

To clone the starter directly from GitHub, visit the repository https://github.com/pantheon-systems/gatsby-wordpress-starter and click
**Code** to open the clone dropdown and select your preferred method.

To create a new project using the `gatsby-wordpress-starter` as a template, [use the `gatsby new` command](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/reference/gatsby-cli/#creating-a-site-from-a-starter).

- If gatsby-cli is installed locally:

   ```bash{promptUser: user}
   gatsby new my-gatsby-wordpress-starter https://github.com/pantheon-systems/gatsby-wordpress-starter
   ```

- If you are using npx:

  ```bash{promptUser: user}
  npx gatsby new my-gatsby-wordpress-starter https://github.com/pantheon-systems/gatsby-wordpress-starter
  ```

If you have a package manager preference, you must set it in the `gatsby-cli` options before initiating your new project.

```shell
# Set your preferred package manager for npm
gatsby options set pm npm

# Set your preferred package manager for yarn
gatsby options set pm yarn
```
