## Autopilot

Search sites by name and get quick access to details such as when a site was last updated, the deployment destination, status, and the update frequency. To manage settings or apply updates, click **Actions**.

You have the option to discard the test, accept changes, approve, or do more, such as add a threshold or view the Multidev. Click **More Actions** to be directed to the Legacy Dashboard.
