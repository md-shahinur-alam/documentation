Welcome to Pantheon! We want to make it easy for you to move a site from another hosting provider to Pantheon. There are a few methods for migrating your site to Pantheon. Use the following instructions to migrate your site to the Pantheon platform.

<Partial file="drupal/guide-note.md" />

## Guided Migration

This method uses the **Migrate Existing Site** button on the User Dashboard and is the method described in this guide.

## Migrate Manually

Use this process when any of the following apply:

<Partial file="migrate/manual-when-all.md" />
<Partial file="migrate/manual-when-drupal.md" />

For instructions on this method, see [Manually Migrate Sites to Pantheon](/migrate-manual).

## Professional Services

If you would prefer to have our Professional Services team do it for you, learn more about our [Website Migration Service](https://pantheon.io/professional-services/website-migrations?docs) and how we can help you migrate one or hundreds of sites to Pantheon.
