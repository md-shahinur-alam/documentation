Welcome to Pantheon!  We want to make it easy for you to move a site from another hosting provider to Pantheon.  Simply use the following instructions, and you'll be good to go!

There are a few methods for migrating your site to Pantheon:

## Guided Migration

This method uses the **Migrate Existing Site** button on the User Dashboard, and is the method described in this guide.

## Migrate Manually

Use this process when any of the following apply:

<Partial file="migrate/manual-when-all.md" />
<Partial file="migrate/manual-when-wordpress.md" />

For instructions on this method, see [Manually Migrate Sites to Pantheon](/migrate-manual).

## Professional Services

Pantheon's Professional Services team can migrate your site for you. Learn more about our [Website Migration Service](https://pantheon.io/professional-services/website-migrations?docs) and how we can help you migrate one or hundreds of sites to Pantheon.
