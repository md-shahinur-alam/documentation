This guide will show you how to migrate a site that meets the following criteria to the latest version of Drupal:

|                   Pantheon                    |                                                                  Custom Upstream                                                                   |                                                                                             --                                                                                             |

During this process, you will work in a new branch to replace the entire file structure with the code from Pantheon's Integrated Composer upstream, and then re-add your contrib and custom code to the new codebase. Then, you will create Multidev environments on individual sites for testing and to apply any site-specific code customizations.
