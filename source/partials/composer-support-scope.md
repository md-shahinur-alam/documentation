Pantheon supports the version of Composer integrated into the Pantheon platform and available for use with all Drupal 8+ and WordPress sites. Pantheonâ€™s support for Composer is limited to the application level, and any Composer scripts or modifications made with a Composer script are outside the [Pantheon Scope of Support](/guides/support/).
