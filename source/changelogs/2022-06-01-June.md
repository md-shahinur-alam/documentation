## Platform Improvements

### Drupal 9.3.14

[Drupal 9.3.14](https://www.drupal.org/project/drupal/releases/9.3.14) is available for production sites and includes backwards-compatible improvements. [Drupal 9.3](https://www.drupal.org/project/drupal/releases/9.3.0) was released in December 2021. From Drupal 9.3, PHP version 8.0 or higher is recommended; PHP 7.3 and higher remains supported. [Drupal 9](/drupal) sites on Pantheon use [Integrated Composer](/guides/integrated-composer), enabling one-click core updates through the Dashboard. To check for available updates, click **Check Now** from the site's **Dashboard Dev** tab.

### Drupal 9.2.20

[Drupal 9.2.20](https://www.drupal.org/project/drupal/releases/9.2.20) is available and includes backwards-compatible improvements. This is a minor version of Drupal 9 and is available for use on production sites.

### WordPress 6.0

[WordPress 6.0](https://wordpress.org/news/2022/05/arturo/) is the latest major release of WordPress and is currently available on the Pantheon platform. This release features nearly a thousand enhancements and bug fixes.

If you’ve updated the previously released Twenty Twenty-two theme outside of Pantheon's WordPress upstream, updating to WordPress 6.0 will result in an error, due to the [removal](https://core.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/53286) of the `wp-content/themes/twentytwentytwo/assets/fonts/LICENSE.md` file. To resolve this error delete this file, commit, and push your change, then reapply the update. Detailed information on applying and debugging core updates can be found in the [Core Updates documentation](https://docs.pantheon.io/core-updates). 

## Documentation

[Drupal 9 Migration Guides](/drupal-migration) - The new Drupal 9 Migration Guides have been published. This is a major rework of the existing guide and provides greater assistance to users when choosing their upgrade path, creating separate guides for each path, or adding content for previously undocumented paths. 

[Using Solr 8 on Drupal 9](/guides/solr-drupal/solr-drupal) - Pantheon Search is now in General Availability. Pantheon Search is a system for indexing and searching site content.

Pantheon provides Solr-based search as a service for all environments. Currently, the default version of Solr on Pantheon is Apache Solr v3.6, but we recommend using Solr v8.
