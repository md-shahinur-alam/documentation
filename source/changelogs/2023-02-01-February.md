## Feature and Product Release Updates
 
#### Enterprise Billing Center
Pantheon’s new Enterprise Billing Center brings accessible and detailed reporting to you via the Pantheon Dashboard. Use the this feature to easily understand your invoices or to see engaging data visualizations that show how individual sites contribute to overall costs. To learn more about Pantheon’s Enterprise Billing Center, refer to our [documentation](/guides/enterprise-billing-center).
 
#### Front-End Sites
Pantheon Front-End Sites provide users with tools that improve the experience of building a decoupled site. Front-End Sites expedite the delivery of key functionality for site creation, accelerate time to value for new users, and improve development and editorial experiences. You can build a decoupled site on Pantheon using your own configuration or with one of our trusted development starter kits. To learn more about Front-End Sites, refer to our [documentation](/guides/decoupled-sites/). 

#### Localdev
Pantheon will discontinue support for its built-in [Localdev](/guides/local-development) feature in June 2023. Check out [this](https://pantheon.io/blog/pantheon-localdev-will-be-discontinued-june-2023) blog post to learn more about well-supported local development alternatives or read our [documentation](/guides/local-development) to learn more about this feature.

#### Pantheon Object Cache 
Services like Redis greatly accelerate web performance by offloading heavy database and fileservice interactions to a fast in-memory cache. Pantheon Object Cache Update allows customers the ability to adopt Redis server 6.x. This capability is made possible by adopting Pantheon’s modernized infrastructure and cloud operations frameworks. To learn more about Object Cache, refer to our [documentation](/guides/object-cache).

#### Roles and Permissions  
Enhancements to the Workspace dashboard allow admins greater visibility and control over user roles, access levels, and privileges. Now, admins can perform periodic audits of users and permissions by Site or Workspace, communicate development work to specific users by Site group, and quickly onboard and offboard users at the Workspace and Site level. To learn more about roles and permissions, refer to our [documentation](/guides/account-mgmt/workspace-sites-teams/teams).

#### WordPress Multisite
Pantheon users with Gold tier accounts (or above) now have the option to create their own WordPress Multisite. To enable the WordPress Multisite option on your account, contact your Customer Success Manager. To learn about WordPress Multisite, refer to our [documentation](/guides/multisite/).
